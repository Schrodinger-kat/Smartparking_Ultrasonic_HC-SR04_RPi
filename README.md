SmartParking Using ioT is an ioT based college project I worked its coding aspects in the year 2016 which uploads realtime slot details to an iOT server(mqtt) and can be accessed through a mobile application.
This Repository contains code for managing the interactions among the ultrasonic HC-SR04 in Raspberry Pi's.
